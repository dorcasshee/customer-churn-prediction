# Predicting Customer Churn for TrustTelecom
## ‚≠ê Overview 
This project builds a **machine learning classifier** to **predict customer churn** for a telecommunications company, **TrustTelecom**. The best-performing model is deployed using a Flask API in Docker, which allows end users to interact with it through a **web form built with HTML and CSS**.

This project was completed as part of an **AI deployment course** in a pairwork setting. The model was previously hosted on **AWS EC2** for grading purposes.

### Repository Structure
- ü•¨ `notebooks/research.ipynb` - contains analysis and model
- ü•¨ `notebooks/api_query.ipynb` - example query using API call
- üßÄ `data/sample.csv` - sample data for example API query
- ü´ì `src/model.py` - loads exported Model using `joblib` for predictions
- ü´ì `src/app.py` - details main app logic for requests made via UI Form and API calls
- ü´ì `src/input_processing.py` - validates and formats the necessary model inputs from form responses
- üçû `requirements.txt ` - lists required packages

## ‚≠ê Model Selection and Results
### Selected Model: CatBoost Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning
We selected our features through a mix of **correlation analysis** and **exploratory data analysis**, arriving at the final set of 14 features:
1. `age`
2. `senior_citizen`
3. `married`
4. `num_dependents`
5. `tenure_months`
6. `num_referrals`
7. `paperless_billing`
8. `has_internet_service`
9. `has_unlimited_data`
10. `has_premium_tech_support`
11. `total_monthly_fee`
12. `total_charges_quarter`
13. `avg_long_distance_fee_monthly`
14. `avg_gb_download_monthly`

We experimented with different classifiers (_Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost, CatBoost_), picked the model with the best AUC score, which was the **`CatBoost Classifier`** at **0.8792**.

We then performed **hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV** (Best Parameters: 'depth': 4, 'iterations': 100, 'l2_leaf_reg': 1, 'learning_rate': 0.1) to **optimise** the AUC score, arriving at a final score of **0.8809**.

## ‚≠ê How to Run
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorcasshee/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

### 2. [Optional] Create a virtual environment
You may want to use a virtual environment for dependency management. You can run the following commands to create and activate a new virtual environment:
```powershell
python -m venv [venvName] # only run once
[venvName]\Scripts\activate # windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This might take a few minutes.

### 4. Run the Flask app
```powershell
python src\app.py
```

### 5. Access the web app
You can access the web app at `http://localhost:5000`.  
You should see a web form like this:

### 6. [Optional] Deactivate the virtual environment
```powershell
deactivate
```
